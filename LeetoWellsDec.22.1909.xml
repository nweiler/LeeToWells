        <salute>Dear <rs type="person">Mr Wells,</rs></salute>
        <p>I have asked your friends to lunch + hope to see them someday soon. About your letter. I hesitate what to say, or to say anything. Yet silence or evasion seems disrespectful to its unflinching frankness.</p>
          <p>I have been turning the matter round + round in my thoughts, hoping, wishing, to find at last a point of view from which I could find it <hi rend="underline">all right</hi>. But I find that I always revert back to the same position which is the only one that is natural to me. The story is easy to understand, easy to sympathise with, even easy to excuse; it is familiar, the same as or related to so many which one knows or guesses. But it seems to belong to the past + to the present which is a bit of the past, + I am unable to translate it into such terms as would stand on a deliberately or at least courageously turned over page of the future. It jars moreover in its details with some of the notions deepest ingrained in me. My experience as a woman and a friend of women persuades me that a girl, however much she may have read and thought + talked, however willing she may think herself to assume certain responsibilities, cannot know what she is about as a married or older woman would, + that the unwritten code is right when it considers that an experienced man owes her protection from himself – from herself –</p>
          <p>This point of view of mine nothing can change, + I believe that a change upon this point means not progress in our standard, but lapse such as has always been + occasionally always must be.</p>
        <p>I have a feeling also, though there is much to be said on the other side, that laws should be broken deliberately, at least openly – At all events what grieves me is not that those who have eaten the cake + drunk the wine should pay the price of it, but that part of the price should be paid by others who have not had their share. In all this story the really interesting person seems to me to be your wife, and it is <hi rend="underline">her</hi> future, her happiness for which I am concerned.</p>  
          <p>And I cannot help thinking also of the damage which this baseness has done to utopias + utopians; above all, of the recrudescence of prejudice and horrid suspiciousness which will come in the way of the possible comradeship of so many men + girls.</p>
        <p>There! That’s what my judgement, do what I will, always returns to; and to hide it would poison all the friendship we may, I hope and, wish still have. But while it is right you should know how I feel, I want you to know at the same time that I have not really lost my trust in you. Your books – even many passages of <rs type="book">Veronica Ann</rs> – about <hi rend="underline">furtiveness</hi> e.g. have inspired me with respect and liking greater than that for any living writer; and I shall therefore continue to hope and even in a way to believe that impossible though it be for you to show or for me to see, there yet remains an explanation of all this matter which – both the point of view and the actual facts - may be worthy of what I have imagined you to and am still willing to give you credit for.</p>    
        <p>As I write these things they sound presumptuous and self-righteous. But one thing you and I do, I feel sure, agree upon, namely, that although those who are not tempted cannot judge of the difficulty of resisting; those on the other hand, who <hi rend="underline">are</hi> tempted, cannot judge of the need which the community has of demanding that temptation should be resisted.</p>
        <p>It is possible that this crude + perhaps prejudiced criticism may put an end to your side of our friendship. Should this be the case, it will not alter <hi rend="underline">mine</hi>.  I shall always remain your <hi rend="underline">sister in utopia</hi>; and so long as both of you wish it, your and your wife’s affectionate friend.</p>
          <p>I shall of course try to avoid all discussion of your concerns with others; whatever I am forced to say (as little as possible) will be in the spirit of what I have said to you.</p></div>
