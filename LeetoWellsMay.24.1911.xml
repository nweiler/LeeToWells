        <note type="summary">This is one letter from Lee to Mrs. Wells, Amy Catherine Robbins, "Jane" Wells. It is the only in this series, so far. It discusses Lee's dislike of H.G. Wells' book, the New Machiavelli and that Lee is afraid that the Wells won't want her to visit with them in the fall because she does not like the book. Wonders if this will marr their friendship.</note>

        <salute>Dear <rs type="person">Mrs Wells</rs></salute>
        <p>Forgive me for not answering at once; forgive me for not having answered a very kind letter of yours last autumn; I have been ill on and off all winter, and struggling to finish off two excessively boring and hateful books between fits of gout and influenza.</p>
        <p>It is very dear of you to want to have me in <rs type="location">Normandy</rs> - I know the country (at least I know the <rs type="location">Seine at Caudebec + Jumièges</rs>) - and it is enchanting. But this summer my way to <rs type="location">England</rs> will necessarily be through<rs type="location">Germany</rs>, where I must see <hi rend="strikethrough">people</hi> some people who won’t be there in autumn, + it must be as direct as possible from <rs type="location">Germany</rs> to <rs type="location">London</rs>, where I have various business. But on my way home, latish in Sept. I shall pass through <rs type="location">France</rs>, and I will knock at your door if you and <rs type="person">Mr Wells</rs> still care to have me.</p>
        <p><hi rend="underline">Still care to have me</hi>. Because, dear <rs type="person">Mrs Wells</rs>, my long silence is also partly due to my difficulty in writing about the <rs type="book">New Machiavelli</rs>; + that difficulty is simply that I feel awfully out of sympathy with <hi rend="person">Mr Wells’</hi> present attitude, an attitude which I cannot but attribute to exasperation at the unjust criticism he has had to suffer from. I don’t believe that under other circumstances the writer of <hi rend="underline"><rs type="book">Anticipation,</rs></hi> of <hi rend="underline"><rs type="book">Lewisham</rs></hi> + of <hi rend="underline"><rs type="book">Tono Bungay</rs></hi> would rail + scold at the world’s imperfections as if he carried the remedy in his own small pocket; surely, of all people such a humourist must know that the world’s lack of order, harmony, nay sense, is merely the multiplication of all our individual shortcomings - another thing I am out of sympathy with is a sort of bravado, a perpetual insinuation that he is going to say shocking things (which he doesn’t!) e.g. all that talk of <rs type="person">Machiavelli’s</rs> fleshliness as introduction to a story which is no more <hi rend="underline">fleshy</hi> than <rs type="person">Goethe’s</rs> <rs type="book">Elective Affinities</rs>, and what I hate still worse, the preface to <unclear><rs type="person">[Meeks]</rs></unclear>, <hi rend="strikethrough">making</hi> preparing the reader to find that most decent doctrinaire an obscene jail bird - All this seems to me to be mere injustice + violence bred of other folks’ injustice + violence, and tall talk resulting from tall talk (not <hi rend="underline">high thinking and loving</hi> but <hi rend="underline">tall talking and scolding</hi>. And I feel as if the perpetual reiteration of the words <hi rend="underline">sex</hi> and <hi rend="underline">sexual</hi> were - forgive me saying so, mere inverted Puritanism. I feel as if the <hi rend="underline"><rs type="periodical">Spectator</rs></hi> had got the better of <rs type="person">Mr Wells</rs> - by making him wish to justify its absurdities. And that makes me miserable, + I just can’t bear the <rs type="book">New Machiavelli</rs>, for all the excellent things (though far fewer than usual in his novels) in it.</p>
        <p>This being the case, how can I come to you, dear <rs type="person">Mrs Wells</rs>, or rather how can you want to have me, who must seem merely one of the hypocrites and sticks in the mud to be swept away by Dick’s <hi rend="strikethrough">patent vacuum</hi> social patent <hi rend="underline">vacuum cleaner</hi>? Do you see? If you both think that we can through innate liking + sympathy, talk ourselves back into agreement, then I will come. But perhaps the best will be to let absence + silence do their work: we are all too honest + intelligent, + too united on our fundamental views + wishes, not to return to our friendship. But you see, I have in fairness to tell you how I feel; and you cannot like, or understand, my feeling as I do.</p>
        <p>That’s what I want to say. And to repeat to you that I shall always be grateful for the immense pleasure + comfort which <rs type="person">Mr Wells’</rs> previous books have been in my life; and, dear <rs type="person">Mrs Wells</rs>, for the unexpected + uncalled for friendliness with which both of you have treated me.</p>    
          <p>All this is a moment of storm, and we have taken different <hi rend="strikethrough">parts</hi> <hi rend="above">sides</hi>. But surely the atmosphere will clear + we shall find each other again.</p>
          <closer>Meanwhile I am your afft</closer>

          <p><hi rend="uncertainplacementforthistext">In <rs type="person">Foemina’s (Mme Bulteau’s)</rs> <rs type="book">L’Ame des Anglais</rs> there is a splendid appreciation of <rs type="person">Mr Wells</rs> - and oddly enough, in a chapter showing how far more passionate + deep French English novels are because of their refusal to call spades spades.</hi></p></note>
