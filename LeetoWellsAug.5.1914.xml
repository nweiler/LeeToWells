        <salute>My dear<rs type="person">Mrs Wells</rs></salute>
        <p>It doesn’t seem likely that I shall get to you on the 10th; all trains here in the south are disorganized, + I don’t know in the least where I shall, or indeed can, go. I am very sorry, for I should have liked to see you + hear what <rs type="person">Mr Wells</rs> has to say. Bar atomic bombs, it seems all just as bad and absurd + horrible as the War in his last book. Only will <hi rend="strikethrough">any</hi> the United States of Europe, indeed anything except famine + barbarism, come out of it? I have tried to understand + to me it seems <rs type="location">England</rs> has made this Belgian business a mere excuse: what else is the meaning of the <rs type="periodical">W.G.</rs> asking “Whether we could have looked on from <rs type="location">Folkestone Leas</rs> at <rs type="person">Boulogne</rs> being bombarded”  - And in this war, much as I dislike Prussian Junkerdom (which war + the fear of war alone makes dominant) my abhorrence of <rs type="location">Russia</rs> - abhorrence inherited from my father who was brought up in <rs type="location">Poland</rs> + strengthened by all I have seen + read - entirely throws my sympathies onto the German side. <rs type="location">France</rs> has been worked up to this pass by <rs type="location">Russia</rs> + by <hi rend="underline">us</hi> + our Entente: before 1904 there was practically no nationalism, or if so, against <hi rend="underline"><rs type="location">England</rs></hi>. <rs type="location">Alsace</rs> itself will be trampled + destroyed; its commercial interests bound it to <rs type="location">Germany</rs> + it wanted only autonomy as a state of the Empire - All this I have gathered not from <hi rend="underline">German</hi> friends, for I have but few + am not in correspondence with them, but from <hi rend="underline">French</hi> ones, of whom I have many. We do not see that we - or rather <rs type="location">Russia</rs> using us - surrounded <rs type="location">Germany</rs> with a wall of enemies which she must break through. All the Belgian neutrality is bosh: first because <rs type="location">Germany</rs> offered to respect <rs type="location">Belgium’s</rs> independence providing she let her have free passage; + we have not put <rs type="location">Belgium</rs> in the position of being eventually destroyed if <rs type="location">Germany</rs> gets the better: <hi rend="strikethrough">we simply</hi> real neutrality of <rs type="location">Belgium</rs> + real independence would have meant leaving her to accept <rs type="location">Germany’s</rs> proposal, instead of ( as of course we + <rs type="location">France</rs> have) bullying the unfortunately little country into saying <hi rend="underline">no</hi>, +  embroiling her as chief battlefield.</p>
        <p>Forgive my pouring out: I want all my friends to know just to what an extent I am utterly out of sympathy with our Gov<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>, our parliament, + I fear, with our nation which in four days has become the prey of <rs type="periodical">Daily Mail</rs> + <rs type="periodical">Times</rs>. I don’t know whether even <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will want to see me later, people are so queer + perhaps one has to be a cosmopolitan in education + without English belongings to escape war fever. So I am doubly sorry not to be able to come there. I am staying on here till the railway service becomes regular; + letters are forwarded from <rs type="location">6 Chesham Street. S.W.</rs> Poor <rs type="person">Elizabeth Arnim</rs>; it must be hard for her.</p>
        <closer>Remember me to <rs type="person">H.G.W.</rs> + believe me Yours always</closer>
