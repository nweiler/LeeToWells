                <salute>Dear Mr Wells</salute>
                <p>I shall be leaving this on the 1st and hope to be with you on the 
                    15th July, remaining till convenient, till the 18th, a Saturday.</p>
                <p>Do not arrange for a meeting between me and <rs type="person">William James</rs>. My position 
                    towards him is far more complicated + difficult than that of intellectual 
                    opposition (perhaps you have glanced at the <hi rend="strikethrough">Need</hi> <hi rend="underline">
                    Will to Believe</hi> paper in 
                    the book dedicated to you?). It is this. Many years ago Mr William
                    James, whom I know slightly, attacked me very violently (privately) 
                    for having put a person resembling his brother into one of the stories of a 
                    volume (quite forgotten) called <hi rend="underline">Vanitas</hi>. The attack was exaggerated and unmannerly, 
                    and it had the effect that for more than ten years Mr <hi rend="underline">Henry</hi> James, an old, kind + 
                    dear friend of mine, refused (without having read that story) to meet me. Some 
                    years ago we <hi rend="underline">did</hi> meet, and are, I trust, good friends again. But I have no wish 
                    ever to meet Mr William James, whose fraternal fury not merely cost me a 
                    friendship which I greatly prized, but (I being then comparatively young) broke 
                    my nerve utterly as a writer of modern stories, filling me with the constant 
                    fear of putting in real people - </p>
                 <p>That is my care. By an odd coincidence, after admiring Wm James’s Psychological 
                     work more than everything, and even (this was after that quarrel) writing in 
                     favour of the <hi rend="underline">Lange=James</hi> theory, I had occasion to fall foul of him in his
                     “Will-to-Believe” capacity; and now I have ready half a volume against <hi rend="underline">Pragmatism</hi> 
                     as incarnated in him + <rs type="person">Schiller</rs> - Everyone who knows of 
                     our quarrel will imagine that my hostility (I being a woman!) to the “Will to Believe” 
                     is due to William James’ having been horrid about that old story of mine. 
                     <hi rend="underline">It is not so.</hi> 
                     But, what between my poor little story in the past, and my articles against 
                     Pragmatism in the present + the future, I think a meeting between us would be a mistake.</p> 
                <closer>I will write later to <rs type="person">Mrs Wells</rs> to settle more exactly. 
                    Meanwhile my love to her + all thanks to both, Yrs truly
