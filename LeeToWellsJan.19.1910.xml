                <salute>Dear Mr Wells,</salute>
                <p>dear friend – I don’t know exactly what it is I want to 
                    write, except that what I wrote last represented only 
                    one half of me – and represented it in a cut - + - dry, crude, 
                    pedantic, self righteous form. I do think all that. But I think 
                    and feel also that you are one of the greatest and dearest of living
                    persons, and that your books, even your worst, are far above the best 
                    thought and will of those who fall foul of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, dear Mr Wells, since I speak of falling foul 
                    (and in the literal sense “foul”) of your books, I want 
                    to say again, and after oh such sickening discussions of 
                    <rs type="person">Ann Veronica</rs>, that you must not 
                    give all of us who are faithful to you the misery which 
                    will of the discussions which will ensue if at this moment 
                    you write more things that can be connected with your 
                    personality, or interpreted in the light of your own case. 
                    Everyone mis-states the story of Ann Veronica in terms of 
                    your own universally known story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My love to your wife and believe me
                </p>
                <closer>Yours always <signed><hi rend="underline">V. Paget</hi></signed>
                </closer>
                <postscript>
                    <p>
                        P.S. If you have a book dealing with love etc ready, 
                        hold it back till it can be read for what it is, people 
                        will forget, if <hi rend="underline">you don’t</hi> remind them. I am not counselling 
                        cowardice. If I thought people could follow your reasons 
                        and arguments, I should say “write it all out boldly and 
                        state your case directly.” But anything you write now will 
                        be merely skimmed as a text for dirty puritan comment. 
                        Very intelligent people have told 
                        me e.g. that <hi rend="underline"><rs type="person">Ann V.</rs></hi> was
                        <hi rend="underline">stealing another woman’s man</hi> and that Capes was 
                        exactly <hi rend="strikethrough">like </hi> 
                        the same as Ramage! There is a run on the book because of its 
                        “psychological interest.”
